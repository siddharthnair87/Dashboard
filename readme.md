This is a group project. The problem we were trying to solve is to measure the impact the School of Code bootcamp has had on the lives and careers of graduates.
Our solution is split into three parts. 

We have three repos - 2 front-ends and a back-end.

This is one of the parts. We visualize data collected from our survey form in the form of graphs and charts so that it is easy to distinguish trends.
